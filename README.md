# Random Forest

Using Python to implement random forest algorithm. The supporting functions are as follows:

- Decision tree classifier;
- Decision tree regression;
- Random forest classifier;
- Then forest regenerator;
- The classifier supports Gini and entropy splitting, and the regressor supports MSE and MAE splitting.

Controllable decision tree depth, maximum number of leaf nodes, minimum number of split samples, maximum tree of random forest, maximum characteristic number, etc.

The results of decision tree and random forest are compared with those of decision tree and random forest in sklearn. The results show that the results of classifier are consistent, the results of single decision tree of regression are consistent, and the results of random forest are slightly different.

See the example in **_demo.py for details.
